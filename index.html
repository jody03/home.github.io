          operators. As part of the Altai Travel family, we operate all of our trips personally and take
          complete ownership of your adventure from beginning to end.
          We're passionate about adventure travel and committed to providing the best possible
          experiences in the world's most outstanding locations. We realised that the key to this is
          setting up and running our adventure operations directly in more than 30 countries in every
          corner of the world. This approach allows us to ensure the highest levels of safety and
          quality in everything we do. Our meticulous teams in the UK and across our destinations
          worldwide can focus on perfecting their knowledge of the beautiful locations we sell and
          creating authentic experiences for you to enjoy.</p>
